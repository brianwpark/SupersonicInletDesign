# SupersonicInletDesign

This Matlab script is for calculating the parameters of a supersonic inlet for a given conditions.

There are two parts to the code.

Part 1. 
<details><summary>
</summary>

This part calculates: 
- Area of the entrance of the inlet
- Length of the ramp
- Exit height 

at the liftoff condition.

Inaddition, these conditions are calculated for the supersonic cruise condition:
- Mass flow rate at the entrance 
- Stagnation pressure at the exit
</details>
Part 2.
<details><summary>
</summary>

This part creates graphs for:
- stagnation conditions at the exit of the inlet
- fractional stagnation pressure loss
- mass flow rate entering the inlet

at Mach numbers ranging from 1 to 1.8.
